/*Jamie is a programmer, and James' girlfriend. She likes diamonds, and wants a diamond string from James. Since James doesn't know how to make this happen, he needs your help.

Task
You need to return a string that looks like a diamond shape when printed on the screen, using asterisk (*) characters. Trailing spaces should be removed, and every line must be terminated with a newline character (\n).

Return null/nil/None/... if the input is an even number or negative, as it is not possible to print a diamond of even or negative size.*/

function diamond(n) {
	let arr = [...Array(n)];
	let arr2 = [];
	let a = '*';
	let counter = 1;
	for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		arr.splice(Math.ceil(n / 2) - 1 - i, i + 1, a);
		arr2.push(arr.join(undefined))
		if (counter < n) {
			a += '**';
			counter += 2;
		} else {
			a = a.replace(/\*{2}/, '');
		};
	};
	let res = arr2.join(' ').replace(/\s/g, '\n');
	return res;
};

console.log(diamond(7));
